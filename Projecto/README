Problem: We have assay data from a series of analytes. We want to fit a model to
 each replicate of data, then measure how well the model fits.
Approach: 
1. Read in the data from a .xlsx file "Data_for_Sarah" and use weighted_fitting.
py to:
2. Take a starting guess at parameter values for the model
3. Evaluate the model at these guesses and calculate the error
4. Minimize the error
5. Record the quality of fit with the "backfit" value obs/pred
Results: Stored in "Backfitting_Results.txt", a file containing each series of backfit values according to the analyte and replicate it came from.
Next steps are to begin implementing Bayesian priors into fitting methods. Now I have the Python power!
